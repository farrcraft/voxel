# Voxel

A Minecraft inspired random voxel world generation app.


## Dependencies

### My own local base code libraries

* v3dlibs
* stark

### 3rd party libraries

* SDL 2 (2.0.3)
* boost (1.57)
* glew (1.11.0)
* glm (0.9.6.1)
* log4cxx
* libnoise (1.0)
* freetype (2.5)

CMake should be installed to build some of the 3rd party libraries.

SDL 2 requires the old DirectX SDK.  The new Windows SDK will not work.

libnoise requires the MFC components to be installed with Visual Studio.
